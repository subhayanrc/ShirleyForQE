     Parallel version (MPI), running on     4 processors
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       4
     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = VDW-DF2 ( 1  4 13  0 2 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
