This is the distribution of the Yambo code.

Yambo doesn't stand for anything like "Yet Another Many-Body cOde", for instance. 
Unless you really want it to. 

Quick installation instructions for the impatient:
   ./configure [options]
   make all
("make" alone prints a list of acceptable targets). Binaries go in bin/.
