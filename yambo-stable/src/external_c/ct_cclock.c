/*  Zachary Levine   7 Dec 1994 Copyright

    Simple ANSI c routine which returns cpu time in seconds.
    Suitable for a call by a Fortran program.
    Usage (fortran): call cclock(cpu) for double precision cpu.
    Results are implementation-dependent with no particular guarantee
    of accuracy in the results.
