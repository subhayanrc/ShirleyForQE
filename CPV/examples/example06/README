This is a second example of how to use cp.x to calculate Wannier functions 
(contributed by people at IRRMA Lausanne)

The first calculation finds the electronic ground state, while the
subsequent one calculates Wannier orbitals for a water molecule,
using Jacobi Rotation as localization algorithm (wfsd=3).
